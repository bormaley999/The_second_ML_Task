# The second ML project
This the fork of my "The_first_ML_Task"(https://github.com/bormaley999/The_first_ML_Task) but with different currency (JPY) and different time frame (01.01.16 and 01.08.2019)

The .csv file is the source data (dataset) I used to build the model. The currency is JPY, time period presented in the report is between 01.01.16 and 01.08.2019. The ML library is scikit-learn. I used Linear Regression function "

class sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression(
  fit_intercept=True, 
  normalize=False, 
  copy_X=True, 
  n_jobs=None
).
Specifically, this example: reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y).
